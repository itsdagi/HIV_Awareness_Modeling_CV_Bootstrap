#1 - Generate a random sample of size 250, using the middle four digits of your ID in set.seed(), from        chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. Provide descriptive summaries for your data and also justify the reason why chose those summaries. Draw histogram of your data and comment on it.

# Answer

# first lets set or generate the randome variable below
```{r results="hide"}
set.seed(9713)  # my ID: GSR/9713/17  Dagim Alemu
randNums <- rchisq(420, df = 2)  # this generates 420 samples with a degree of freedom of 2 and setting them to a variable called randNums
head(randNums)

```

# basic summary of the generated data above 

```{r results="hide"}
library(e1071)
summary(randNums)  # maximum , min , quartile first and third second being median ðŸ«¡
sd(randNums)       # Standard deviation
var(randNums)      # Variance

skewness(randNums) # it measures asymmetry meaning could be left or right skewed 
kurtosis(randNums) # it measures wherether or not the data is picked or not 

# Further justification and reasons Justification:Mean, Median, Min, Max: Give an overview of central tendency and range of data. SD, Variance: Measure the spread of the data. Skewness, Kurtosis: These help analyze the distribution's shape; skewness for asymmetry, kurtosis for tail weight.
```
# Histogram plot 

```{r}
# histogram plot
hist(randNums, breaks = 20, col = "lightblue", border = "darkblue",
     main = "Histogram of Chi-Square Distribution (df=2)",
     xlab = "Score", ylab = "Probability", probability = TRUE)

# Add Chi-Square probability curve for comparison
curve(dchisq(x, df = 2), col = "darkgreen", lwd = 2, add = TRUE)

# Description: This histogram shows how often different scores appear 
# in our sample from a Chi-Square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. 
# The blue bars represent our data, while the green line shows the expected 
# shape of this distribution.

# 2 second question 

# loading stata fiile first 
```{r results="hide"}
library(haven) # should install haven for  package first to load dta for stata files first since the data is using the latest stata file version 
women15_49 <- read_dta('women15_49.dta')
head(women15_49)
```
# setting with my middle id and taking 2500 rows from the data set 
```{r results="hide"}
set.seed(9713)
newDf <- women15_49[sample(nrow(women15_49), 2500), ]
```

# a) Provide socio-demographic(select five of them from the data) table by their knowledge where to get the test.

```{r results="hide"}


#  converting v783 col to factor
newDf$v783 <- factor(newDf$v783, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("No Clue", "In the Know"))


#  v012:- Respondent's current age  v024:- Region v106:- Highest educational level v130: Religion v151: Sex of household head

# converting them to factors
newDf$v024 <- as.factor(newDf$v024)
newDf$v106 <- as.factor(newDf$v106)
newDf$v130 <- as.factor(newDf$v130)
newDf$v151 <- as.factor(newDf$v151)

# create the table
socio_demographic_table <- table(
  Knows_HIV_Test = newDf$v783,
  Age = newDf$v012,
  Region = newDf$v024,
  Education = newDf$v106,
  Religion = newDf$v130,
  Head_Gender = newDf$v151
)

# Print the table
print(socio_demographic_table)
```

B) Suggest the most appropriate model to assess association between your outcome vari
able and set of your explanatory variables.

```{r results="hide"}
# I choose the logistic regression model because the outcome variable is binary (yes or no)
# Using v012 (age), v024 (region), v106 (education), v130 (religion), and v151 (sex of household head) as explanatory variables

# Fit logistic regression model
model <- glm(v783 ~ v012 + v024 + v106 + v130 + v151, 
             data = newDf, family = binomial(link = "logit"))

```

# c) Using 10 fold cross-validation. Select the model that you think is the best.

# Logistic regression model with no special settings has RMSE of 0.463, RÂ² is 0.088, and MAE is 0.423. This mean model explain little about knowing where to get HIV test. Because RÂ² very low, we can make model much better.

# The estimated mean CD4 count is 246.65, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 240.47 to 253. The estimated median CD4 count is 246, with a 95% confidence interval between 240 and 254. This means we are 95% confident that the true mean and median CD4 counts fall within these intervals.
